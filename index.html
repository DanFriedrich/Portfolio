        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>From an early age, I've always been around computing. Since my first computer, a windows 98 machine, I've been all about wanting to know how they work, 
          disassembling and reassembling them and of course, gaming.</p>

        <p>When I was 8 years old, my parents gave me a Playstation 2 Video game Console and another world was shown to me. My fascination for video games grew. I wanted
          to know how they were made, coded, how every ambient and character was modeled. That interest grew and by the time I was 15, I enrolled in a course for Video Game Design
          which lasted 2 years. There, in the Microcamp technical school, I learned the basics about all parts of making a video game - from story telling to 3D Modeling and of course,
          coding.
        </p>

        <p>As I finished my video game design technical course as well as High School, I decided to enroll in the course of Digital Games the FAESA college offered. There I made new 
          friends and was introduced to new aspects of not only game design, but also web design, data banks and applications. From June to October, 2019  I got my first job as an 
          intern in a company that provided mobility as a service, similar to Uber. There I learned Front-end coding in Java, as well as design in XML and CSS using Android Studio 
          and PHP back-end coding.
        </p>

        <p>As I concluded college I imediately started another. This time, Systems Development and Analysis. I deepened my knowledge of software architecture and found another 
          Internship. I worked for a full year as an IT intern for a very popular school in my state (UP - Uni√£o de Professores). It was in UP that I, along with two other employees
          were responsible for the installation and configuring of all computers and projectors in all classrooms, as well as passing every single ethernet cable through walls, setting
          up Switches and over all making sure the entire school had proper access to internet and all equipment worked accordingly. This also included, of course registering students
          in the School App and answering calls from parents and students, clearing any doubts and solving problems. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Then in 2021, an opportunity arose to work at an IT Company that provides support services to many other companies throughout the country. There I learned to open computers,
          assemble and set them up and also, of course repair them. Then in august, that same company came up with the idea to open up a store that provided the same repair services,
          but for ordinary passersby customers. This time around, however we would also provide repair services for cellphones. Seeing an opportunity for knowledge and better overall
          experience, I jumped at the offer even though it would mean giving up the 5 minutes walk from home to work, for an hour long trip in a bus every day. Knowledge is priceless
          after all and learn I did. It wasn't easy, but it was surely an amazing experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now I have experience dealing with clients, reparing notebooks, computers and cellphones, programming, 3D modeling, Web Design, Game Design and I am sure there is a lot more
          room to grow. I don't know what the future holds, but I will face it with perseverance and optimism.
